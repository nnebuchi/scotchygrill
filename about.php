            <p class="scotchy-body-2 mt-5">
              Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Founder Marlon Llewellyn, successful
              school education leader, would help his mother Carol, aka Blossom,
              as she ran the family restaurant. His mother has been a
              restauranteur in Jamaica for over ten years, so opening a
              restaurant continues the family legacy of bringing people
              delicious Jamaican food.

              <br />

              <br />On February 23. 2021, at 9pm, Marlon journaled the concept
              of Scotchy Jamaican Grill. Instead it was called Blossom’s
              Jamaican Restaurant in honour of his late mother, Carol Blossom.
              On the 10th anniversary of her death, God gently reminded Marlon
              of the vision he wrote down again while in Church: “I am not going
              to allow you to leave this earth until you try everything tell
              you.” was born.

              <br />
              <br />
              This time, he did not allow fear to stop him or ignore that gentle
              voice from being obedient. Instead, Marlon acted on his faith and
              the collaboration between Scotchy Jamaican Grill the and Fishers
              Test

              <br />
              <br />

              Marlon and his son Bryce Llewellyn launched Scotchy Jamaican Grill
              on June 8, 2024 at the Fishers Test Kitchen in Fishers, Indiana,
              two sold out Jamaican experience events. This was the first time
              in the Fishers Test Kitchen’s history that a new concept was
              launched wth tw sold-out dinner seatings, and the kitchen had a
              Jamaican cuisine concept fort he first time.
